# Mongoose


## 1. Istallation 

To install mongoose you can run the following command

```bash
pnpm i mongoose
```

## 2. Connecting to MongoDB

To connect mongoose we do something like this: 

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/<database-name>");
```

## 3. Creating a model

A model is a schema that will represent a collection in the database.

Example:
```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  status: String,
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

## 4. Adding extra methods to the model

Sometimes we want to  add some extra convienient methods to the model, for example we might want to add a method that will greet the user, to do that we can do something like this:

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  status: String,
});

userSchema.methods.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

## 5. Overriding the toJSON method

the toJson method is used to convert the model to a JSON object, usually it is called when you are returning the model in a response, overriding this method will allow you to add extra fields to the JSON object and also remove any sensitive fields.

To overload the toJSON method you can do something like this:

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  status: String,
});

userSchema.methods.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

userSchema.methods.toJSON = function () {
  const user = this.toObject();
  delete user.age;
  return user;
};


const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```


## 6. Creating a document

To create a document you can do something like this:

```js
import User from "./models/user.js";

const user = new User({name: "John Doe", age: 25, status: "active"});
// save the document to the database
user.save();
```

## 7. Creating multiple documents

To create multiple documents you can run the following command,

```js
import User from "./models/user.js";

const users = [
  {name: "John Doe", age: 25, status: "active"},
  {name: "Jane Doe", age: 25, status: "active"},
];
```


## 8. Finding all the documents in a collection

To find all the documents in a collection you can do something like this:

```js
import User from "./models/user.js";

const users = await User.find();
```

## 9. Finding all the documents in a collection that match a certain criteria

To find all the documents in a collection that match a certain criteria you can do something like this:

```js

import User from "./models/user.js";

const users = await User.find({status: "active"});
```

## 10. Finding all the documents in a collection that match a certain criteria and format the output

To find all the documents in a collection that match a certain criteria and format the output you can do something like this:

```js
import User from "./models/user.js";

const users = await User.find({status: "active"});
```
