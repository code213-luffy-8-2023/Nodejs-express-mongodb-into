# Express JS

## What is Express JS?

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

As We have seen with plain nodejs, we can create a server and listen to the request and send the response. But it is not that easy and straight forward. it might seem easy because we were only serving a single page, but the second we start to add more pages and more routes, it will become very difficult to manage.

Express is a framework that sits on top of nodejs and makes it easier to manage the routes and requests.

## Installing Express

First, we need to create a new project folder and initialize it with npm.

```bash
mkdir express-demo
```

```bash
cd express-demo
```

```bash
pnpm init
```

If we want to use ES6 modules, we need to add the following line to the package.json file.

```json
"type": "module",
```

Now we can install express.

```bash
pnpm i express
```

## Creating a Server

Now we can create a server with express.

```js
import express from "express";

// create an express app
const app = express();

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

## Installing nodemon

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

```bash
pnpm i nodemon --save-dev
```

Now we can add the following script to the package.json file.

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  },
```

Now we can run the server with the following command.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Now the server will be running but we have no made any request handlers yet. So if we go to localhost:3000, we will get an error.

## Creating a Route

A Route is a combination of a request method and a URL path.

If your domain is `example.com`, then the following are examples of routes:

- `GET /` is the route for the home page.
- `GET /about` is the route for the about page.
- `POST /api/users` is the route for creating a new user.
- `PUT /api/users/1` is the route for updating the user with id 1.
- `DELETE /api/users/1` is the route for deleting the user with id 1.

and so on, you get the idea.

Now let's create a route for the home page.

```js
import express from "express";

// create an express app
const app = express();

// create a route for the home page
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // respond with "Hello World" when a GET request is made to the homepage
  res.send("Hello World");
});

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

Now if we go to localhost:3000, we will see the "Hello World" message.

Lets break down the code.

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});
```

The `app` object has methods for all the HTTP request methods. In this case, we are using the `get` method. The first argument is the path and the second argument is the callback function that will be called when a request is made to that path.

The callback function is called a middleware function. it will receive three arguments, `req`, `res`, and `next`.

- `req` is the request object. It contains all the information about the request (What the client sent).
- `res` is the response object. It contains all the methods to send a response. (What we send back to the client).
- `next` is a function that we can call to pass the control to the next middleware function.

In this case, we are using the `send` method of the `res` object to send a response back to the client.

## Serving Static Files

Now let's create a route for the about page.

```js
import express from "express";

// create an express app
const app = express();

// create a static files server for the public folder
app.use(express.static("public"));

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

## Serving JSON Data

In most cases you will be using express to create your backend logic, while your frontend will be handled by a separate react app.

So in most cases you will be sending json data to the client.

```js
import express from "express";

// create an express app
const app = express();

// return a user object to the client
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
  });
});

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

## Handling POST Requests (reading the request body)

A request body is data sent by the client to your API. It could be data sent by the user through a form, or data sent by the client application.

In order to read json data sent by the client, we need to use the `express.json()` middleware.

```js
import express from "express";

// create an express app
const app = express();

// use the express.json() middleware to read json data sent by the client
app.use(express.json());

// return a user object to the client
app.post("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  console.log(user);
  res.json(user);
});

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

**Example**

Lets create a simple `fake` api that is capable of

1. sends a list of users to the client when a `GET` request is made to `/api/users`
2. creates a new user when a `POST` request is made to `/api/users`
3. updates a user when a `PUT` request is made to `/api/users/:id`
4. deletes a user when a `DELETE` request is made to `/api/users/:id`

**Steps**

1. Create a new project folder and initialize it with pnpm.

```bash
mkdir fake-users-demo
```

```bash
cd fake-users-demo
```

```bash
pnpm init
```

2. Install express.

```bash
pnpm i express
```

3. Create a `server.js` file and add the following code.

```js
import express from "express";

const users = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Jane Doe",
    age: 25,
  },
];

// create an express app
const app = express();

// use the express.json() middleware to read json data sent by the client
app.use(express.json());

// return a user object to the client
app.get("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

// create a new user
app.post("/api/users", (req, res) => {
  const user = req.body;
  users.push(user);
  // send status code 201 (created) to the client
  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// update a user
app.put("/api/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = Number(req.params.id);
  const user = req.body;
  const index = users.findIndex((user) => user.id === id);
  users[index] = user;
  res.json(user);
});

// delete a user
app.delete("/api/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = Number(req.params.id);
  const index = users.findIndex((user) => user.id === id);
  const user = users.splice(index, 1);
  res.json(user);
});

// listen to the request
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
});
```

4. Run the server.

```bash
node server.js
```

5. Test the API using postman.

- Open postman and create a new request.
- Set the request method to `GET` and the url to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
- Click on the `Send` button.
- You should see a list of users.
- Now change the request method to `POST` and the url to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
- Click on the `Body` tab and select `raw` and `JSON` from the dropdown.
- Add the following json data to the body.

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Jack Doe",
  "age": 35
}
```

- Click on the `Send` button.
- You should see the newly created user.
- Now change the request method to `PUT` and the url to `http://localhost:3000/api/users/3`
- Click on the `Body` tab and select `raw` and `JSON` from the dropdown.
- Add the following json data to the body.

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Jack Doe",
  "age": 40
}
```

- Click on the `Send` button.
- You should see the updated user.
- Now change the request method to `DELETE` and the url to `http://localhost:3000/api/users/3`
- Click on the `Send` button.
- You should see the deleted user.
- Now change the request method to `GET` and the url to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`
- Click on the `Send` button.
- You should see the list of users without the deleted user.
