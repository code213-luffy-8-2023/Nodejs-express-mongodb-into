# NodeJS Introduction

## NodeJS Introduction

### What is NodeJS?

NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, NodeJS wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

### Pros and Cons of NodeJS

#### Pros

- **Performance**: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google, which compiles JavaScript to native machine code, leading to fast execution.
- **Asynchronous and Non-blocking**: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture that supports non-blocking I/O operations, making it highly scalable for I/O bound tasks.
- **Single Language Stack**: Developers can use JavaScript for both server-side and client-side scripting. This can lead to increased efficiency and consistency in web development.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: The Node Package Manager (NPM) provides a vast library of packages and modules, making it easier to add functionality to applications.
- **Active Community**: Node.js has a strong, active community that contributes to its continuous improvement, develops packages for npm, and offers support.
- **Versatility**: It's suitable for a wide range of applications, from web applications to real-time applications like gaming or chat applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, it's easy to scale applications horizontally (adding more machines).
- **Cross-platform**: Node.js applications can run on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with no modifications.

- **Reduced Development Time**: Reusable modules and templates in the npm registry can significantly reduce development time.

- **Enhanced with Continuous Updates**: Regular updates are released, and they come with new features, performance improvements, and security patches.
- **Unified Database Queries**: Many NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, use JSON-like format data, allowing for seamless integration in Node.js applications.

#### Cons

1. **Not Ideal for CPU-intensive Tasks**: While great for I/O-bound operations, it can fall short for CPU-bound tasks as the single-threaded nature might block the event loop.

2. **Learning Curve for Asynchronous Programming**: Developers coming from synchronous programming languages might find the asynchronous nature of Node.js challenging initially.

3. **Lack of Conventions**: Compared to some other frameworks or languages, Node.js doesn't enforce a specific way to structure an application, leading to potential inconsistency.

4. **Security Concerns**: With the vast number of modules available, there are concerns related to using outdated or insecure packages, which can introduce vulnerabilities.

### How to run a javascript file using nodejs?

1. Create a file named `hello.js` with the following content:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

2. Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node hello.js
```

### Nodejs and Event Loop

NodeJS is a single threaded application but it support concurrency via concept of event and callbacks. As every API of NodeJS are asynchronous and being a single thread, it uses async function calls to maintain the concurrency. Node uses observer pattern. Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute.

**Example**

Since NodeJS is used to run backend servers, every new request from a client is handled by nodejs, if node js did not have an event loop, it will need to answer each request one by one, meaning it needs to serve the first request and then the second and so on.

Obviously this is not a good idea, so instead, nodejs uses an event loop, so when a request comes in, nodejs sends it to the event loop where it will be handled in a future time (remember promises) , now node can handle a second request, and when ever the first request is done, the event loop will send it back to nodejs to handle it.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
// assumes you have a file called file.txt
fs.readFile("file.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // print the data to the console
  console.log(data);
});

console.log("This is after the read call");
```

**Output**

```bash
This is after the read call

<Buffer 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 63 6f 6e 74 65 6e 74 73 20 6f 66 20 66 69 6c 65 2e 0a>
```

### NodeJs Build-in Modules

Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.

#### Core Modules

The Node.js Core API provides a set of built-in modules that you can use without any further installation, here are some of them:

- **crypto**: To handle OpenSSL cryptographic functions.
- **dns**: To do DNS lookups and name resolution functions.
- **events**: To handle events.
- **fs**: To handle the file system.
- **http**: To make Node.js act as an HTTP server.
- **https**: To make Node.js act as an HTTPS server.
- **net**: To create servers and clients.
- **os**: Provides information about the operation system.
- **path**: To handle file paths.
- **querystring**: To handle URL query strings.
- **readline**: To handle readable streams one line at the time.
- **stream**: To handle streaming data.
- **string_decoder**: To decode buffer objects into strings.
- **timers**: To execute a function after a given number of milliseconds.
- **tls**: To implement TLS and SSL protocols.
- **url**: To parse URL strings.

##### Examples

**Example 1: Reading a file**

1. Create a demo file named `demo_file.txt` with some content in it.
2. Create a js file named `demo_readfile.js` that reads the HTML file asynchronously and prints the content:

```javascript
// demo_readfile.js

// import the fs module
const fs = require("fs");
/**
 * fs.readFile() is used to read files on your computer.
 * If the file does not exist, an error will be thrown.
 * If no encoding is specified, then the raw buffer is returned.
 * The first argument is the file path, the second argument is the encoding type.
 */
fs.readFile("demo_file.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  console.log(data.toString());
  console.log("This will print (after reading the file)");
});

// this will print first
// because nodejs does not wait for the file to be read
// so any code after the readFile will be executed
console.log("This will print (before reading the file)");
```

3. We can also read the file synchronously

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// read the file synchronously
// this will block nodejs, meaning during the time the file is
// being read nodejs can't do any other task
const data = fs.readFileSync("demo_file.txt");

// print the content
console.log(data.toString());
```

**Example 2: Creating a file**

1. Create a js file named `demo_createfile.js` that creates a new file using the `fs.writeFile()` method:

```javascript
// demo_createfile.js

const fs = require("fs");

// create a file named demo_createfile.txt
// if the file already exists, the content will be overwritten
fs.writeFile("demo_createfile.txt", "Hello World!", (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File created successfully");
});
```

**Example 3: First Web Server**

In this example we will create our first web server backend.

1. Create a js file named `demo_server.js` that creates a web server that listens on port 3000 and writes a response to the client that says "Hello World":

```javascript
// demo_server.js

// import the http module
const http = require("http");

// create a server object
// the function passed into the http.createServer() method, will
// be executed when someone tries to access the computer on
// port 3000.
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // write a response to the client
  res.write("Hello World!");
  // end the response (this is required)
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3000); // the server object listens on port 3000
```

**Example 4: Serving HTML**

1. Create a demo HTML file named `demo_html.html` with some content in it.
2. Create a js file named `demo_html.js` that reads the HTML file and return the content:

```javascript
// demo_html.js

const http = require("http");

// import the fs module
const fs = require("fs");

// create a server object
http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    // read the html file
    fs.readFile("demo_html.html", (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // write the content of the html file to response
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
      res.write(data);
      res.end();
    });
  })
  .listen(3000);
```

**Example 5: Serving JSON**

1. Create a demo JSON file named `demo_json.json` with some content in it.

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

2. Create a js file named `demo_json.js` that reads the JSON file and return the content:

```javascript
// demo_json.js

const http = require("http");

// import the fs module
const fs = require("fs");

// create a server object
http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    // read the json file
    fs.readFile("demo_json.json", (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // write the content of the json file to response
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" });
      res.write(data);
      res.end();
    });
  })
  .listen(3000);
```

**Example 6: Serializing/De-Serializing Javascript objects to JSON**

`Serializing` means converting an object to a string.
`De-Serializing` means converting a string to an object.

This is a very common task in web development, for example, when you send data from the client to the server, you need to serialize the data to a string, and when you receive the data on the server, you need to de-serialize the data to an object.

objects live in the memory, and strings live in the hard drive/network etc..., so when you send data from the client to the server, you need to serialize the data to a string, and when you receive the data on the server, you need to de-serialize the data to an object.

1. Create a js file named `demo_serialize.js` that serializes and de-serializes a javascript object:

```javascript
// demo_serialize.js

// import the fs module
const fs = require("fs");

// create a javascript object
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",
};

// serialize the object to a string

// JSON.stringify() converts a javascript object to a string
const personString = JSON.stringify(person);

// print the string
console.log(personString);

// save serialized string to a file
fs.writeFileSync("person.json", personString);
```

2. run the file `node demo_serialize.js`
3. check the file `person.json` to see the serialized object.
4. Create a js file named `demo_deserialize.js` that de-serializes the object:

```javascript
// demo_deserialize.js

// import the fs module
const fs = require("fs");

// read the file
const personString = fs.readFileSync("person.json");

// JSON.parse() converts a string to a javascript object
const person = JSON.parse(personString);

// print the object
console.log(person);
```

5. run the file `node demo_deserialize.js`

###### Exercise 1: Create a web server that returns a random number between 1 and 10

1. Just like in the examples before, create a js file named `demo_random.js` that creates a web server that listens on port 3000 and returns a random number between 1 and 10.

###### Exercise 2: Create a web server that returns a random word everytime the page is refreshed.

1. Create a js file named `demo_random_word.js` that creates a web server that listens on port 3000 and returns a random word everytime the page is refreshed.
2. Create a file named `words.json` that contains a list of words, each word in a new line.
3. Read the file `words.json` and store the words in an array.
4. Generate a random number between 0 and the length of the array.
5. Return the word at the index of the random number.
6. Hint: use the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
7. Hint: use the `Math.floor()` function to round a number down to the nearest integer.
8. Hint: use the `Math.ceil()` function to round a number up to the nearest integer.
9. Hint: use the `Math.round()` function to round a number to the nearest integer.

```json
// words.json
[
  "apple",
  "banana",
  "orange",
  "mango",
  "kiwi",
  "pineapple",
  "strawberry",
  "blueberry",
  "raspberry",
  "blackberry",
  "grape",
  "watermelon",
  "melon",
  "peach",
  "pear",
  "plum",
  "cherry",
  "apricot",
  "avocado",
  "coconut",
  "fig",
  "grapefruit",
  "lemon",
  "lime",
  "papaya"
]
```

### Using ES6 Modules in NodeJS

NodeJS supports ES6 modules, but you need to use the `type="module"` in the package.json file.

to create a package.json file, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm init
```

then add the following line to the package.json file:

```json
"type": "module"
```

Now you can use ES6 modules in your nodejs application.

**Example**

1. Create a file named `demo.js` with the following content:

```javascript
// demo.js

// import the fs module
import fs from "fs";

// read the file
const data = fs.readFileSync("demo.txt");

// print the content
console.log(data.toString());
```
